# TI-Apps
These are a bunch of various programs I made for my TI-84 graphing calculator. They are usually adaptions of common mathemathical functions, but they might be something else...

When I get yelled at for not doing my english essay, you'll know exactly why :P

# COSLAW
This app is an adaption of the cosine law. It has 4 inputs:

A / thetha - the angle/side that you want to solve for
A / thetha - the coressponding angle/side that of the unknown angle or side
B - Another side that you know
C - Another side that you know

When you want to solve for an angle/side, simply plug in 0 for A or thetha, and then the program will take care of the rest!
